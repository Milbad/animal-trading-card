			In many languages, the word for "bat" is cognate with the word for "mouse": for example, chauve-souris ("bald-mouse") in French, murciélago ("blind mouse") in Spanish, saguzahar ("old mouse") in Basque, летучая мышь ("flying mouse") in Russian, slijepi miš ("blind mouse") in Bosnian, nahkhiir ("leather mouse") in Estonian, vlermuis (winged mouse) in Afrikaans, from the Dutch word vleermuis (from Middle Dutch "winged mouse").</p>

									<p>Bats are flying mammals. While others can glide, bats are the only mammals capable of continued flight. There are over 1000 different bat species. Bats are nocturnal (active at night). Bats "see" in the dark using a special skill called echolocation.  Most bats feed on insects, while others eat fruit, fish or even blood!
